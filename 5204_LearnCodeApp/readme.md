# Http5204 Passion Project: PUNCHCODE 

The pitch: Directory app to discover coding resources from the web. 

## The Vision  
Punchcode features resources for new learners of coding.
Learners would be able to save their favorite resources, follow other learners, write tutorials
and study together.

## The reality
Punchcode is an attempt to build out the minimum viable product (MVP) that would bring this vision to life.

## Challenges 
One of the most difficult challenges was just trying to understand the
inner-workings of the asp.net. Next is setting up the database. I spent many hours trying to set up the database properly.
I re-did the project 3 times to ensure that all the relationships between tables were set up properly.  However, I was
sadly mistaken. The tables looked ok but the many-to-many relationships did not work (implicit or explicit) since nothing could be saved that involved the 2 tables.
Another challenge was understanding how the view models worked, their relationship to the controllers.
and how to get multiple tables printed on a single page (if that makes sense). 


#Future Features
